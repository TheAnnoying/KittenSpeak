# KittenSpeak

Make your messages sound like a cat~

## Installation
Follow [the Vencord documentation](https://docs.vencord.dev/) to install Vencord from source.

From the `userplugins` folder, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheAnnoying/KittenSpeak
```
Rebuild Vencord (reinject if necessary) and you should be good to go! You can now enable the plugin from your Discord settings.

## Todo
- [ ] If the message is too long, don't apply changes to it (& show a toast about it)
- [ ] If a changed message is edited, re-apply the indicator at the end of the message if it was deleted.
- [ ] If a message is edited but is made to be too long, don't apply changes to it (& show a toast about it)
